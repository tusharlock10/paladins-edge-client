# Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- Create a issue for the feature/bug and raise a PR linking to the issue.
- Provide appropriate labels to the issue and PR.

## Pull Requests

PRs to Paladins Edge are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation for the changes wherever appropriate.

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

Contributors should follow these guidelines when creating PRs

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name. E.g. feat/feature-name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

These are just the conventions we follow, they might not be the best and hence, if you have any ideas to improve the process, please open an Issue for the same.
